\begin{theorem}
Let $X$ be a topological space and let $A \subseteq X$ be any subset.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item A point is in $\operatorname{Int} A$ iff it has a neighborhood contained in $A$.
\item A point is in $\operatorname{Ext} A$ iff it has a neighborhood contained in $A^C$.
\item A point is in $\partial A$ iff every neighborhood contains a point of $A$ and a point of $A^C$.
\item A point is in $\bar{A}$ iff every neighborhood of it contains a point of $A$. 
\item $\bar{A} = A \cup \partial A = \operatorname{Int} A \cup \partial A$.
\item $\operatorname{Int} A$ and $\operatorname{Ext} A$ are open in $X$, while $\bar{A}$
    and $\partial A$ are closed in $X$.
\item The following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item $A$ is open in $X$.
    \item $A=\operatorname{Int} A$
    \item $A$ contains none of its boundary points.
    \item Every point of $A$ has a neighborhood contained in $A$.
    \end{enumerate}
\item The following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item $A$ is closed in $X$.
    \item $A=\bar{A}$.
    \item $A$ contains all of its boundary points.
    \item Every point of $X\setminus A$ has a neighborhood 
        contained in $X\setminus A$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
(a, $\Rightarrow$) 
If $x \in \operatorname{Int} A$, which is defined as a 
union of open subsets of $A$, then $x$ must have been contained in one of 
these open sets, $N_x$, which is a neighborhood of $x$ contained in $A$.

(a, $\Leftarrow$) 
Suppose $x$ has an open neighborhood $N_x$ contained in $A$. 
Then $N_x$ is an element of the union defining $\operatorname{Int} A$, and 
thus $ x \in N_x \subseteq \operatorname{Int} A$.

(b, $\Rightarrow$)
Suppose $x \in \operatorname{Ext} A$. Then $x \in X \setminus \bar{A}$. Thus
there must exist some closed set $B \supseteq A$ such that $x \not\in B$.
So $x \in B^C \subseteq A^C$, with $B^C$ the complement of a closed set, and thus
open.

(b, $\Leftarrow$)
Suppose $x \in X$ has an open neighborhood $N_x$ such that $N_x \subseteq A^C$. 
Since $N_x$ is open, $(N_x)^C$ is closed, and contains $A$. Thus it is part
of the intersection defining $\bar{A}$, so
$\bar{A} \subseteq (N_x)^C$. Thus $\bar{A}^C = X \setminus \bar{A} 
=\operatorname{Ext} A \supseteq N_x$, which contains $x$. Thus
$x \in \operatorname{Ext} A$.

(c, $\Rightarrow$)
Suppose $x \in \partial A$. Then $x$ is in neither the interior of $A$ nor
its exterior. Then consider an arbitrary neighborhood of $x$, $N_x$. If 
$N_x$ did not contain an element of $A^C$, $N_x$ would be a subset
of the interior of $A$ (it would be part of the union in the interior) 
and thus $x$ would be in the interior; contradiction, $N_x$ contains
an element of $A^C$. Then suppose $N_x$ contains no element of $A$. Then 
$N_x \subseteq A^C$; then $(A^C)^C = A \subseteq (N_x)^C$. So $(N_x)^C$
is part of the intersection in the closure; that is, 
$\bar{A} \subseteq (N_x)^C$. Thus $N_x \subseteq \bar{A}^C =
\operatorname{Ext} A$. But this implies $x$ is in the exterior of $A$;
contradiction. Thus $N_x$ contains both an element of $A$ and an element of
$A^C$.

(c, $\Leftarrow$)
Consider any $x \in X$ with the property that every neighborhood of it contains
an element of $A$ and an element of $A^C$. Then $x$ cannot be in the interior,
since then it would be in some open set $N_x$ in the interior's union, which
would also contain a point of $A^C$, which contradicts the requirement that
$N_X \subseteq A$. It also cannot be in the exterior if it were in the exterior,
then it would not be in the closure of $A$, which means there must exist some
$B \subseteq X$ such that $x\not\in B$, $B \supseteq A$ and $B$ is closed.
But then $x \in B^C$, which is open, and $B^C \subseteq A^C$. This $B$ cannot
contain any element of $A$, and yet this is a neighborhood of $x$, which 
contradicts our assumptions regarding $x$. Thus, if every neighborhood of
$x$ contains elements of both $A$ and $A^C$, then $x$ must be a boundary point.

(d, $\Rightarrow$)
Suppose $x \in \bar{A}$. Either $x \in A$ or not. If $x \in A$, then every
neighborhood of it must contain a point of $A$. If $x \not\in A$, then
$x \in \partial A$ or $x \in \operatorname{Ext} A$. The latter would imply
the existence of an open neighborhood $N_x$ of $x$ contained entirely in $A^C$,
implying that (closed) $(N_x)^C$ entirely contained $A$, and hence it is 
part of the intersection defining the closure; so $x \not\in (N_x)^C$ which
contains $\bar{A}$, hence $x \not\in \bar{A}$. Contradiction. If, instead,
$x \in \partial A$, (c) guarantees the point required.

\begin{definition}[Topological basis, def.\ A]\label{topbasisA}
A \textbf{basis} for a topological space $(X,\tau)$ is a collection $\beta \subseteq \tau$ 
such that for any $U \in \tau$ and $x \in U$, there exists some $B \in \beta$ such that
$x \in B \subseteq U$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Topological basis, def.\ B]\label{topbasisB}
A \textbf{basis} for a topological space $(X,\tau)$ is a collection $\beta \subseteq \tau$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\beta$ covers $X$; that is, $\bigcup_{B \in \beta} B = X$, and
\item any $U \in \tau$ can be written as a union of sets in $\beta$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
Definitions \ref{topbasisA} and \ref{topbasisB} are equivalent.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
For the sake of discussion we will refer to a collection $\beta \subseteq\tau$ 
matching Definition \ref{topbasisA} as a \textbf{A-basis} 
and one matching Definition \ref{topbasisB} as a \textbf{B-basis}.

(A$\to$B)

Suppose that $\beta\subseteq\tau$ is an A-basis for $(X,\tau)$. Then for any $x \in X$, there must
exist some $B \in \tau$ such that $x \in B \subseteq X$. Hence every element of $X$ is in some
element of $\beta$; $\beta$ covers $X$, the first condition of \ref{topbasisB}. 

Consider then an arbitrary $U \in \tau$; for each $x \in U$, let $B_x$ denote the set guaranteed 
by \ref{topbasisA} such that $x \in B_x \subseteq U$. Then observe that 
$\bigcup_{x\in U} B_x = U$; if $x_0 \in U$, then $x_0 \in B_{x_0} \subseteq \bigcup_{x\in U} B_x$
and thus $U \subseteq \bigcup_{x\in U} B_x$. If $x_0 \in U^C$, then $x_0 \not\in B_x$ for each
$x\in U$. Consequently, $x_0 \not\in\bigcup_{x\in U} B_x$. Hence 
$U^C \subseteq \p{\bigcup_{x\in U} B_x}^C$, and thus $\bigcup_{x\in U} B_x \subseteq U$. Thus,
$U = \bigcup_{x\in U}$. Hence any arbitrary open set in $\tau$ can be expressed as a union of sets
in $\beta$, completing the definition of a B-basis. All A-bases are also B-bases.

(B$\to$A)

Suppose that $\beta\subseteq\tau$ is a B-basis for $(X,\tau)$. Then suppose we are given some 
$U \in \tau$ and $x \in U$. Then by the definition of a B-basis, there exists some 
$\Gamma \subseteq \beta$ such that $\bigcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \gamma = U$. Since
$x = U = \bigcup_{\gamma\in\Gamma} \gamma$, $x \in \gamma_x$ for some 
$\gamma_x \in \Gamma \subseteq \beta$. 
Furthermore, by the nature of a union, $\gamma_x \subseteq U$. 
Hence for each $U$, and $x \in U$, there exists some 
$\gamma_x \in \beta$ such that $x \in \gamma_x \subseteq U$. Consequently, $\beta$ is also an
A-basis. All B-bases are also A-bases.

Definitions \ref{topbasisA} and \ref{topbasisB} imply each other, and thus they are equivalent.
