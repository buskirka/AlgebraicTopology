\section{$n$-manifolds}
% \begin{lemma}\label{lemma1}
% Every manifold has a countable basis of coordinate balls.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
% Suppose $X$ is a manifold, and consider an arbitrary open
% $U \subseteq X$. Since $X$ is a manifold, it is second countable
% and thus has a countable 
% basis $\mathcal{B}$, and for some $B \in \mathcal{B}$,
% $B \subseteq U$. For any $p \in B \subseteq U$ (we assume we pick this
% consistently for each $B$; i.e. we have a choice function on $\mathcal{B}$) 
% we also have a 
% coordinate chart $(C_B,\varphi_B)$, $p \in C_B$, $C_B$ homeomorphic by
% $\varphi_B$ to an open neighborhood of $\R^n$. Since $\varphi_B$ is 
% a homeomorphism and $B$ is open, $\varphi(C_B \cap B)$ is open in
% $\R^n$, and further $\varphi_B(p) \in \varphi_B(C_B \cap B)$. Since 
% $\varphi_B(p)$ is an element in an open set, it must permit some open
% ball around it, 
% $V_B=B(\varphi_B(p); \epsilon) \subseteq \varphi_B(C_B \cap B)$. Then
% $\varphi_B^{-1}(V_B) \subseteq C_B \cap B$, and 
% $(\varphi_B^{-1}(V_B),\varphi_B|_{\varphi^{-1}(V_B)})$ is a coordinate 
% ball chart, and at least one of these fits within our arbitrary $U$.
% Consequently the collection
% of all such coordinate balls, 
% \[ \set{ (\varphi^{-1}(V_B),\varphi_B|_{\varphi^{-1}(V_B)}) : B \in \mathcal{B}}\]
% is a countable basis of coordinate balls.
% \end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
An $n$-manifold has a countable basis of precompact coordinate balls.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $X$ is a manifold. Then by Proposition 4.60,
$X$ permits a countable basis of regular coordinate balls $\mathcal{B}$. 
For each $B$, there exists an open neighborhood $B'$ and homeomorphism 
$\varphi : B' \to B_{r'}(x) \subseteq \R^n$, for which there exists
$r$, $0 < r < r'$ such that $\varphi(B) = B_r(x)$ and 
$\varphi(\bar{B}) = \overline{B_r(x)}$. Since homeomorphic images of
compact sets are compact, $\mathcal{B}$ is compact. Since the closure
of $B$ is compact, $B$ is precompact. Consequently $\mathcal{B}$ is
a countable basis of precompact coordinate balls.
\end{proof}

\section{Compactness implies paracompactness}
\begin{theorem}
Compactness implies paracompactness.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose a space $X$ is compact. Then for any cover $\mathcal{B}
=\set{B_i, i\in I}$ over $X$,
then by compactness we have a finite subcover 
$\mathcal{B}'=\set{B_i, i\in J} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$. Since each 
$B_i \in \mathcal{B}'$ is an open subset of $B_i \in \mathcal{B}$, 
$\mathcal{B}'$ is an open refinement of $\mathcal{B}$. Furthermore, since
$\mathcal{B}'$ is finite, it must be locally finite (each open neighborhood
can only intersect, at most, every element of $\mathcal{B}'$, which is finite). 
Thus
every open cover $\mathcal{B}$ of $X$ admits a locally finite open refinement
$\mathcal{B}'$, so $X$
is paracompact.
\end{proof}
